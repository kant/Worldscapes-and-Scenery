# X-Plane-Scenery
Scenery development for simulations, centered on X-Plane flight simulator
 
Being interested in simulations, I am occupied in the updating and development of scenery for X-Plane 10+. Scenery here is in various stages of development before being submitted to the Scenery Gateway. You are welcome to download, use and improve any objects and location scenery here, but at your own risk. No warranty is implied what-so-ever with these sets.

## Projects

### Miscellaneous Special Objects

### [SpaceX Boca Chica Tx Sites](https://github.com/medmatix/XPStarbase/blob/main/README.md)

Although strictly not an airport, I have created X-Plane 11 scenery for this FAA Licenced / Designated spaceport in South Texas. The, "IATA ID" of the semi-fictious FAA recognised  facility is informally SX20. A zipped version of the most up-to-data installation is here.

### [BCATP Picton Aerodrome]()

The first base airport created for a series of X-plane Airports in the WW2 British Commonwealth Air Training Plan system. This involves the creation of new historical building and structures objects, see [](https://github.com/medmatix//blob/main/README.md), historic WW2 British Static Aircraft, see [](https://github.com/medmatix/XPStarbase/blob/main/README.md), as well as flyable versions of many of the static aircraft.
